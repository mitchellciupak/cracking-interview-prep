# 2.5 Linked List - Sum List

'''
Sum Lists: You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains a single
digit. The digits are stored in reverse order, such that the 1 's digit is at the head of the list. Write a
function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list.
EXAMPLE
Input: (7-> 1 -> 6) + (5 -> 9 -> 2).That is,617 + 295.
Output: 2 -> 1 -> 9. That is, 912.
