## Best Practices

1. Ask clarifying questions.
2. Analyze various solutions and tradeoffs.
3. Plan solution with pseudocode.
4. Implement solution.
5. Test.

## Asking Clarifying Questions

* Should this be done be in place? (No additional memory)
* Can we make any assumptions about the input?
* Do we care more about performance or saving memory?

## DONTs

* Don't make assumptions, just ask

## DOs

* Talk about tradeoffs
* Align the weakness of a solution to the srength of a data structure
* Look for the twist

## What to do when you don't know what to do?
* Take it one step at a time
* Does it remind you of anything you've encountered before?
* Start with a very simple solution
* Then, think about what the bottleneck is or what is the most inefficient part of the algo is
* Worst case: ask for a hink
